# Jarmuz-Status

Jarmuz-Status is a Jablko Mod ([Jablko](https://github.com/ccoverstreet/Jablko)) for checking the status of devices on a network. It stores a user-defined list of IP addresses to poll at a provided interval. The dashboard card features an updating table with device names and statuses and allows users to add and delete devices easily.

More UI feedback is planned in the future.
