# Jablko Mod: Hamster Monitor

This Jablko mod communicates with a wireless microcontroller (eg. ESP8266) to sense if a hamster is active and provides a UI display for a Jablko dashboard. The current iteration uses a PIR sensor, however, this is not very effective for detecting movement in a hamster cage.

This module is part of the early development process of Jablko. This means that it's update cycle will be short and potentially non-backwards compatible between versions.
