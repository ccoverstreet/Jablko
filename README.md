# Jablko Smart Home

## Setting Up

- jablko_sms_config.json
  - This file will contain the gmail account and password for Jablko to send messages through. It is highly advised that this is just a throwaway gmail account as keeping login information in plain-text and allowing unsecure app access in google accounts is not recommended.

        {
          "email": "jablkohome@gmail.com",
          "password": "mypassword"
        }
